        <h1>Interactive Puzzle</h1>
        <p>
          So as I mentioned in my presentation, I planned to do a puzzle board for this project where all of the puzzle pieces would float around the webpage and you would have to click it to put it in place to complete the puzzle. When you completed the puzzle a text box would show up to congratulate your effort and contain a brief introduction about the images chosen for the puzzle. And after completing the project, I'm happy to inform you that I've been able to knock out most of the essential interactive aspects for my webpage and even some Nice to include sections from my presentation. My chosen pairing for this project is playful and feedback and since my website is a literal puzzle game and you can drag the puzzle pieces and click the buttons where some feedback is gonna come back to you, I think this pairing is quite fitting. Although for my text crawl page, I would argue that it leans towards Information Design principles more than just feedback.
        </p>
          <p>For the first page, I want to convey the 500 words description of the website through a text crawl just like the opening of the Star Wars films.
            Then when you scroll down or press a skip button it would lead to the next page. I had planned to include a skip button for the text itself if you want to see the full text without the scrolling animation, but I decided against it because it would be redundant for the audience to read the same information a second time. I settled on this method of communicating information because the 500-word paragraph is required for explaining this project, but I don't want my website to be full of text, so I created a separate page for it that could be linked to the main one. I was inspired by the Star Wars title crawl because I always found that tilting the title crawl rather than just boring vertically straight text paragraphs conveys information in such a fascinating and effective manner, plus it's just too iconic, so why not? The text also faded out gradually using a background gradient that I stick to the top of the webpage. For the skip button, I tried to mimic the hover animation button of the Figma experience which I'll put a link to on the next page.
            </p>
        <p>I took the color palette as well as the font (Chaloops) from my art piece (inspired by the music video by Liam Payne), which is the puzzle for this project, and used it for both of my web pages. The graffiti pop art and the cartoonish vibe is the style that I'm looking for in this project, so I took inspiration from Keith Harring's artworks for the style of the art pieces and the website, which is so unique yet quite simple and eye-pleasing as well. For the background, I used gradient color to recreate the color of my art piece and to make it have a blurry effect just like in the old TV which is the theme for my Figma project. Everything else is pretty self-explanatory, the floating puzzle pieces' position is generated randomly on the right and left side of the screen when you refresh the page, you can drag and drop them onto the 4x3 puzzle board, and the pieces can be shuffled around the board as well. You'll notice that when you drag the pieces to the board, there will still be a tile block left behind. This is intentional because, while this is a simple puzzle, those tiles will act as obstacles to make the game a little more difficult, along with the randomly generated position of the pieces, which gives the game a sense of replayability. If you want to know about the art piece itself, help yourself with the Show Info button, and when you finally complete the puzzle, a pop-up screen will show up to congratulate you for doing so. Finally, there's a turn counter that you can use to track how many attempts you make to solve the puzzle.
        </p>
        <p>That's all for the project, please help yourself and enjoy the game !</p>
