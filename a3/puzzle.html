        <p>A Cardio Exercise - Let’s Strip That Down Like Liam Payne !
        </p>
        <p>What is “strip that down”: Liam Payne's "Strip That Down" Dance is a video of Liam Payne from One Direction dancing to and performing his song "Strip That Down" at the Z100 Summer Bash in August 2018. The dance, which many saw as humorous in its execution, resurfaced and became popularized on TikTok in June 2022 as users began performing it in a dance trend
          I found the dance absolutely ridiculous which make me think how cool it is to turn this into an art piece. This is the first page of a 5 steps on instruction on how to do his dance movements made by me and kind of refine it into a cardio exercise to nurture your health.
