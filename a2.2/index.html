  PROVIDE MEANINGFUL FEEDBACK TO THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS:
  1) <button> with the id of load-link on the loading page (index.html)
  2) <div> with the id of load-throbber on the loading page (index.html)
  3) <li> inside of the <ol> inside of the <nav> on the information page (hosono.html)
  4) <button> with the id of mode-button on the information page (hosono.html)
  5) switchModes() function - hint you can add a transition CSS property to the <body> and it will be inherited 
     by all the elements inside, so when custom CSS variables are changed it will apply transition

<!--Peter's comments: So this is a reminiscence of a Wikipedia page so for me simple is the optimal way here, no need for something flashy just plain and simple and the webpage would do its job just fine.
I only changed the color of the hover function from purple to deep blue since it would be more like to google color scheme. Also, the cursor I changed to a pointer.

<!--
1) For the load-link button I decided to give just a plain curve border with the color scheme of the default website.
2) I've also looked into LinkedIn and some other websites that would serve the same purpose and the simple design here just work well for me. The load-throbber here is heavily inspired by LinkedIn.
3) I put some highlighted hover effects over the information text.
4) + 5) The Light&Dark mode I also did some effects just like the previous ones.

        Typically I'd use an <a> here but as we're faking a load time I'm using a <button> instead.  If it was an 
        <a> I would leave off the target attribute so that it would redirect the current tab.

        The function loadPageAfterDelay() is declared in the file fakeLoad.js - it takes a number value that sets the 
        amount of time it takes in ms and a url to redirect to.

        This is a div we're using for the throbber - if we wanted to do a % based loading bar there is an element 
        called <progress> but as this one is just indicating a wait rather than providing direct feedback on progress I've 
        opted for using a <div>.
